This is a text assistant designed to aid children with dyslexia in writing stories and other texts. The goal is to enhance their writing and reading abilities without requiring intervention from a teacher or parent, except for reading their completed texts. This is made possible thanks to ChatGPT's excellent capability to correct words and sentence structures in incorrect texts.

Key Features of this assistant:

- Corrects text within its dedicated view to avoid disrupting the writer's flow.
- Highlights corrections in both the original and corrected text for easy problem identification.
- Highlights the entire word instead of individual characters to promote problem-solving and careful reading of words.
- It only corrects whole sentences to encourage the completion of sentences before checking for faults, so as not to interrupt the flow of writing.
- Disables the ability to mark the corrected text to prevent "cheating".
- Utilizes OpenAI GPT 3.5 turbo for corrections.
- Supports both English and Norwegian.

How to Use:

- Generate an OpenAI API key by visiting their website and logging in (https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).

- Insert your API key into this field and close the settings window.

- A new editor to the right side of your current editor should now open, and it will automatically correct any text in your currently active/focused editor as you begin writing.
